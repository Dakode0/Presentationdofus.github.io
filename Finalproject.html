        <div><p class="features"> What is Dofus  <br><br>
          Dofus appeared in 2004. Yes, it is dated, but it is still standing and with many regular updates, whether in terms of new content or balancing the existing one. In 2023, the game is at version 2.68. This is a nice progression since its 1.0, and 2.0 in 2010. In addition to new areas and dungeons, an entire universe has been built around Ankama's first real game. A first draft that will convince and allow both the company and the MMO to take off.
          <br>
          In the realm of MMORPGs, World of Warcraft was not the pioneer; titles like Neverwinter Nights, Dark Sun Online, EverQuest, and RuneScape had already left their mark. Dofus, officially released on September 1, 2004, predates WoW by a bit. Following the genre's conventions, Dofus offers a persistent world shared among all players, allowing quests, PvM activities, item exchange, and more without requiring real-time presence.
          
          Where Dofus distinguishes itself is in its gameplay, particularly its Turn-by-Turn mode. Drawing inspiration from Final Fantasy Tactics, it presents a unique blend of RPG and chess-like strategy. Players navigate on a combat board with predefined movement constraints, employing actions such as attack, defend, repel, and heal. This distinctive gameplay carved a niche that resonated with adventure enthusiasts.
